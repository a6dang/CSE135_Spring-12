Assignment 1 Architecture

This webapp follows the model 1 design pattern that features a linear
progression between the pages. The user inputs data on each page, which
is passed and stored in the subsequent page before any new information
processing occurs. The main methods of passing information used during
this assignment was the GET, POST, and session attribute methods. We
created a Student class to facilitate cleaner storage of applicant
information. This was the preferred method over storing several attributes
with session variables.
