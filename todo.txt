Hey. I think this is another convenient way to pass todos to the other person.
If you're finished with a todo, you can just delete it off the list, and if
there's a new one you can just add it here and then when the person checks out
they just need to look at this file to see what's happening.

TODO:
-fix the null value for degree level on degreediscipline.jsp
	-i'm pretty sure it's because i named all the options the same value and
	on the moredegrees.jsp page the processing of it doesn't work out too
	well. so when i print out the thing on verification.jsp it's null.
	not sure if you know what to do.
