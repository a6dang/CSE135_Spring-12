TODO:

- General testing.
- Make sure requirements in spec are fulfilled.
- Bug: If you already started entering degrees for a student,
       if you open another browser of the same type the counter
       is shared between both browsers (e.g. 2 chrome browsers),
       then the counter is messed up. 
       But, I doubt they will test this.
